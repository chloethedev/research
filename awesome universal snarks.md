<br>Given a polynomial commitment schemes from groups of unknown order,instantitate this with class groups, then will  get transparent setup 
and  a few other nice properties . Apply it with Sonic, then will result in something called SuperSonic.
It's a trustless setup SNARK with *log(n)* proof size and *log(n)* verification, quasi-linear prover time + preprocessing, 
as well as 24 kb proof size for 1 million gate circuits.
