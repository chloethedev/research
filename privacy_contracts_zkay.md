The general idea of Zkay language is to introduce privacy types defining owners of private values.<br>
In contrast to distinguish public from private values uing by other language,the only participant who can read them is their owner defined by type system of Zkay.<br>
Next off they use NIZK to enforce the correctness of zkay smart contracts.
## Type System
### Data Type:
* normal types(**uint**,**bool**) ,**address**, **bin**,**mapping**.<br>
Specifically there are two types of mapping including normal mappings(<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\tau_1&space;=>&space;\tau_2&space;@&space;\alpha_2$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\tau_1&space;=>&space;\tau_2&space;@&space;\alpha_2$" title="$\tau_1 => \tau_2 @ \alpha_2$" /></a>),
named mappings(**mappings**(**address**!id => <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$\tau&space;@&space;\alpha$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$\tau&space;@&space;\alpha$" title="$\tau @ \alpha$" /></a>)).
<br>In terms of named mappings,'id'indicates the key of the map to be used in the key type.
### Statements: 
* <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$verify_\phi&space;(e_0,e_1,...,e_n)$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$verify_\phi&space;(e_0,e_1,...,e_n)$" title="$verify_\phi (e_0,e_1,...,e_n)$" /></a><br>
Such an explicit reclassification using Keyword **reveal** supports the behaviour to  reclassify expressions private to the caller which is readable to other accounts but not accessible to caller,so it's unnecessary for public expressions because they are automatically classified.
The use cases of *verify* contain but not limited to:<br>
1. verify circuits for transforming function variants, such as <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=f" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f" title="f" /></a> to <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\overline{f}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{f}" title="\overline{f}" /></a>
2. still have more space to explore ...
* *while* e {P} : fully public, not involve any private variables exactly.


## NIZK proof verification
In NIZK proof they are using within zkay contrats, they use symbolic randomness to generate the proof together with arguments of public and private 
for circuits bound in the proof.The only effective constraints of validation in proofs is <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\phi(v_{1:n},v^{'}_{1:m})" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\phi(v_{1:n},v^{'}_{1:m})" title="\phi(v_{1:n},v^{'}_{1:m})" /></a> equals to 1.<br>
For the reason of why the result should equal to 1,
I recommend you to read the article written by vilalik in medium [Quadratic Arithmetic Programs: from Zero to Hero](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649)
<br>They use ZoKrates to generate  proofs during transformation of transactions. In terms of type mapping, we are able to avoid 
over- and underflows if we map Zkay *uint* types to Zokrates integers directly because all results in computation supported by Zkay is bounded in a finite interval 
which precisely refer to *[0,p-1]* for large prime *p*


## Ownership transfer 
For sake of security, zkay prevents ownership transfer by declaring **final** to owner fields,which means it's not possible 
for owner field with dynamically growing mappings, for example: `final address hospital`


## Correctness in Computation 
They use *T* to make sure all contents in zkay contract *C* is transforming to <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\overline{C}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\overline{C}" title="\overline{C}" /></a>
successfully,including statements and constraints of circuits without throwing any exceptions.<br>

Specifically they apply the recursive transforming expression to the function body,which has been evaluated off-chain for privacy concerns,and the argument itself is private to caller , 
such as <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=T_L=T_e(x&plus;a)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_L=T_e(x&plus;a)" title="T_L=T_e(x+a)" /></a>.
<br>

In addtion to the safety of arguments , the caller are required 
to give the encryption of function for the purpose of proving its correctness while <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=T_L" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_L" title="T_L" /></a>  ensure the runtime location of function is consistent 
through the process.<br>

In terms of encryption of cleartext value of function body, they add a constraint to circuits which involves the encryption key to public arguments and randomness factor to secret proof circuit arguments.
<br>How do they actually keep the computation of cleartext value of function private ? <br>
Basically they make cleartext values of variables accesible to circuits as prerequisites, then move the variables into circuits
by using keyword *in* .<br>

The next problem they need to tackle is the *availability* of variables in curcuits. They pass variables to circuits via public proof circuit arguments and store current states in a fresh local value
in order to make them immutable. The final step is then pass them to circuits at *verify*. <br>

The moving values out of proof circuits is actually repeating the previous process reversely . 


## Execution 
The execution of transactions in zkay involves states updating,formally they will be written as:<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=<T,\sigma>\stackrel{t}{\Rightarrow}&space;<\sigma^{'},v>" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?<T,\sigma>\stackrel{t}{\Rightarrow}&space;<\sigma^{'},v>" title="<T,\sigma>\stackrel{t}{\Rightarrow} <\sigma^{'},v>" /></a>,<br>
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\sigma" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma" title="\sigma" /></a> indicates  state of transaction at present while <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\sigma^'" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma^'" title="\sigma^'" /></a> denotes the state afterwards.<br>

From technical aspect,states specify the values of all fields, for example we write σ = {m → {0 → 5}} to indicate that m[0] holds value 5 .
so transformation between states implies the execution of transactions in return.<br>

The production of every transaction in zkay refers to traces, as they defined, which basically evaluate information leaked during 
execution and to whom it is leaked as well.<br>

In formal language, a trace t is a sequence of entries <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$v_i@a_i$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$v_i@a_i$" title="$v_i@a_i$" /></a>
for values<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$v_i$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$v_i$" title="$v_i$" /></a> and privacy level <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$a_i$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$a_i$" title="$a_i$" /></a>.
Technically we can let privacy level be all to make it accessible to everyone in the network.<br>
