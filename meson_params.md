# Parameterizing Meson
We need to be able to determine what parameters are needed in order to better inform computational requirements for being a provider, auhority, mix. 

## Properties
Meson has a stratified topology. We need to consider the following things when parameterizing:
    - # of ingress providers
    - # of outgress providers
    - # of mix layers
    - # of mixes in each layer
    - # of clients connecting to ingress providers
